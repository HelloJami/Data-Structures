# Data Structures

Description:
This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science. 
Below are some of the key topics covered in this repository.

**Singly Linked List**:

Cpp implementation of a singly linked list data structure, including methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other common operations.

**Stack and Queue**:

stack.cpp: Implementation of a stack data structure using C++.
queue.cpp: Implementation of a queue data structure using C++.

**Expression Evaluation**:

C++ script for evaluating arithmetic expressions, supporting basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Each file contains detailed comments and explanations to help understand the implementation and usage of the respective data structures and algorithms.
